# Smoothing the MC

##############################

To perform a fit to the MC to smooth it and then drawn pseudo-experiments from the fit, run smoothMC.C: 

root -l -b -q smoothMC.C

Look inside the code to set paths, select a function. 
To generate pseudo-experiments from the fit, set the bool "doAndSavePEs" = 1. 
Also, make sure that the folder in "outPEPath" exists before asking for pseudo-experiments.

# Creating signal-injection distributions 
#
########################################

The injectSignal.C code can be used to inject a signal into any distribution. 
It reads the interpolations from SWiFt's morphing folder and can inject a signal shape at ANY mass point. 
This is useful for performing signal-injection studies. 
Before running the code, please set the correct paths and other settings in the code. 
The code also generates pseudo-experiments from the signal-injected distribution if the bool "doAndSavePEs" = 1.

To run the code, do: 

root -l -b -q injectSignal.C
